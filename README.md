### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my Github! My name is Thomas (but my friends call me Ortiz), I'm a full stack software engineer with experience across a variety of technologies and languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C). My recent focus has been on web development in the React / Node.JS ecosystem, building intuitive and efficient user applications. 

### Highlights
- 🔭 I’m currently working on KAT - an open source developer tool to help monitor the deprecation status of Kubernetes API's. I am also actively developing a social media platform called Dunk Tank Social. Check out the pinned repo's for both, and please reach out if you want to contribute!

- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on any open source project where there is a need in the community! I'm comfortable across the full stack and am always excited to learn a new technology.

- 🎸 Outside of coding I am passionate about the guitar (Hendrix, SRV, Grateful Dead), and fitness, and was fortunate enough to hike at 6 different national parks last year.
