### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my Github! My name is Thomas, I'm a full stack software engineer with experience across a variety of technologies and languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C), and have built several web applications with React/ Node.js.

### Highlights
- 🔭 I cofounded KAT - an open source developer tool designed to help monitor the deprecation status of Kubernetes API's. Check out my pinned repositories to see KAT, as well as some other projects I have worked on.

- 🤝 I’m always excited to collaborate on any open source project where there is a need in the community! I'm comfortable across the full stack and am always excited to learn a new technology.

- 🎸 Outside of coding I am passionate about the guitar (Hendrix, SRV, Grateful Dead), and fitness, and was fortunate enough to hike at 6 different national parks last year.
